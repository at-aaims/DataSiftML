    Parameters
        ----------
        epsilon : float, optional, default 1e-4
            A small amount added to the lower bound or subtracted
            from the upper bound. This value prevents infinite number
            from occurring when applying the inverse error function.
        copy : boolean, optional, default True
            If False, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.
            This is not guaranteed to always work inplace; e.g. if the data is
            not a NumPy array, a copy may still be returned.
        n_jobs : int or None, optional, default None
            Number of jobs to run in parallel.
            ``None`` means 1 and ``-1`` means using all processors.
        interp_kind : str or int, optional, default 'linear'
           Specifies the kind of interpolation as a string
            ('linear', 'nearest', 'zero', 'slinear', 'quadratic', 'cubic',
            'previous', 'next', where 'zero', 'slinear', 'quadratic' and 'cubic'
            refer to a spline interpolation of zeroth, first, second or third
            order; 'previous' and 'next' simply return the previous or next value
            of the point) or as an integer specifying the order of the spline
            interpolator to use.
        interp_copy : bool, optional, default False
            If True, the interpolation function makes internal copies of x and y.
            If False, references to `x` and `y` are used.
        Attributes
